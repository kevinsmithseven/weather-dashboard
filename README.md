# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project is an app allows a user to enter a city into a search field and display both the current weather in the upper right section of the page which includes the city, date, current temperature, current wind speed and current humidity. Below that, the five day forecast will be displayed on five separate cards with similar weather information forecasted for each day.

When a user searches for a city, a button will be created below the search bar that will allow the user to click on it at a later time and see the current and forecasted weather for that city. It also includes a dynamically changing icon representing the weather conditions forecasted on that day. The cities are being stored in the local storage of their browser. 

The input field is not case sensitive in case the user forgets to capitalize the name of the city.

Future enhancements will include better mobile responsiveness for the header and a more stylish UI/UX.

## Usage

Upon page load, the user will see a header, an entry field with a placeholder city, a search button, a blank box on the right and an empty 5-Day forecast section. The user will enter a city into the search field and either click the button or hit enter to start the search. The page will then display the current weather data and the five day forecast for the selected city. A button will also appear in the history section below the search bar that the user can click on at any time later to refresh the weather data for that city. If the user submits without entering a city or a city that does not exist, an alert will appear indicating such.
